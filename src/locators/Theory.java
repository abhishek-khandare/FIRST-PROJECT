//		// to create webpage we need to use tagname <html>
//		and to create component or element we need to use tagname <input>
//		to create listbox we need to use <select> tag
//		to create link we need to use <a>tag( anchor)
//		to create web table we use <table> tag
//		
//		
//		1. Tag name - any key which is present after< symbol is known as Tagname.
//		ex.<html>, <input>,<body>
//		
//		2.Attribute - any key which is present after tagname and = symbol is known as attribute
//		ex type='text',  value = 'login' (type is attribute key and 'text' is a attribute value)
//		
//		3.Text -Any body which is present between (><) is known as Text.
//		ex Link1,
//		<html>
//		   <body>
//		      UN<input type = ‘text’ id = ‘abc’> </br>
//		      PWD<input type = ‘password’ id = ‘456’> </br>
//		      <a href = ‘url’> Link1 </a>

//		Locator:
//			1.locator is use to identify the element present in a webpage with the help of locator Types.
//			2.	To identify an element present in a webpage we need to use findElement() method which is present in WebDriver interface.
//			3.	findElement() method will identify an element with the help of By class which contains static methods.
//			4.	All the static methods present in a By class are known as locator types.
//		There are different types of locators : 
//			1.	ID
//			2.	Class
//			3.	Name
//			4.	Tagname
//			5.	Linked Text
//			6.	Partial Linked Text
//			7.	CSS Selector
//			8.	X-path

		
//		Absolute xpath

//		To achieve absolute xpath, we need to use ‘/’.
//	/html/body/div[2]/input[1]
//	Relative xpath
//		Relative xpath is used to navigate from root of parent to any child. 
//		To achieve relative xpath, we need to use ‘//’.
